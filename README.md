# My "dotfiles" for Windows

Based on [Jay Harris's dotfiles](https://github.com/jayharris/dotfiles).

Install by running the files in PowerShell.

Note: You must have your execution policy set to unrestricted (or at least in bypass) for this to work: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`.

Then run:
* `windows.ps1` set a lot of Windows settings.
* `deps.ps1` Installs the package managers.
* `packages.ps1` Install all the software through package managers.
* `personalize.ps1` Personalize computer with git settings, computer name and such. You probably want to edit this ;)
